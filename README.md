Package of implementation of common JS utilities using vanilla JS to refresh love for JS

## Note

* Each folder will have a index.js file - which will have the solution I've written by own
* Later, with help of Chat GPT - code reviewed and updated code will be in corresponding review file

By this way, it helps in crafting this exercise in a engaging manner. If you're using it for referring purpose, do look at the reviewed file as it would have concise code/original source code reference in official repos
